# bloodbank-search-ui
UI for bloodbank search tool at HUP

Premise:

This project is a collaboration between Nico Cernek and a team at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. The goal is to create the UI for a bloodbank search tool. The target audience is medical researchers, whom we assume are non-technical as relates to software and databases.They require a very simple interface that represents data visually.

Stage 0:

Build an app that takes three inputs and returns a two-circle venn diagram where:
  input A defines the first circle,
  input B defines the second circle,
  input C defines the overlap.
